This is a totally unfinished Clojure interface to Tokyo Tyrant. I thought I
was going to need it for a business situation, but then the situation
changed.

I won't be developing it any further. If you want to use this code in any way,
go ahead. This is licensed under the WTFPL.

This is what's implemented so far:
    
    user=> (use 'tyrant)     
    nil
    user=> (tyrant-put "a" "b")
    (0)
    user=> (tyrant-get "a")
    (0 0 0 0 0)
